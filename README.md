# About
The Python Task Manager, a Python-based interface, is a user-friendly tool that uses the tkinter library to list and display system process information. It provides functionalities for monitoring and managing processes, including processes, performance, app history, startup apps, users, details, and services. The system information display uses psutil to fetch and display detailed information about system processes, organized in a tabular Treeview widget. The program also includes interactive features, including buttons for managing or interacting with listed processes and system functionalities, although actual actions are placeholder functions.

# Features
The Python Task Manager is a user-friendly tool that allows users to manage system processes through a graphical interface built using the `tkinter` library. It allows users to monitor and manage processes running on their system, providing information about active processes, resource usage, and other relevant details. The tool covers various functionalities related to process management, such as displaying a list of currently running processes, providing performance metrics, tracking app history, listing startup apps, showing logged-in users, providing detailed information about system processes, and listing system services and their status. The tool also fetches detailed information about system processes using the `psutil` library, organized in a tabular format. Users can interact with listed processes and system functionalities using placeholder buttons, which allow actions like terminating processes or adjusting settings. The tool lays the groundwork for future functionality, and developers can replace placeholders with real implementations as needed. The Python Task Manager is continually refined and enhanced, with features like error handling, responsiveness, and additional features to make it even more robust.

# Usage
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts software development projects using Git, a distributed version-control system. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world, providing features such as version control, collaboration, issue tracking, documentation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), social networking features, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Pages.

Version Control: GitHub provides a robust system for tracking changes to files and directories within a project, allowing for easy understanding of the project's history and reverting back to previous states. Collaboration: Multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously, forking, making changes, and submitting them through pull requests. Issue Tracking: GitHub offers tools to track bugs and feature requests, assigning them to project members, labeling them, and closing them once resolved.

Documentation: GitHub supports Markdown, allowing project maintainers to create rich documentation directly in their repositories. CI/CD integration allows for automated testing and deployment of software. Social networking features allow users to follow each other, bookmark projects, and receive notifications on updates.

GitHub Actions allows for automation of workflows, allowing for build, test, and deployment pipelines within the repository. GitHub Pages provides hosting for static websites directly from the repository, making it an excellent tool for project documentation or personal blogs.

# Rating
The application offers comprehensive system monitoring, providing a detailed view of system processes for monitoring and resource management. Its modular design separates the UI setup from data fetching and processing, making the code more maintainable. The structured and organized GUI makes it accessible for users to navigate system metrics. However, the application's practical utility is limited by the absence of implemented functionalities beyond the placeholder print statement. Performance optimization could improve the application's ability to refresh process data in real-time or on demand, and improve error handling and user feedback mechanisms. Overall, the program's potential as a system monitoring tool requires enhancements to enhance its utility and user experience.
